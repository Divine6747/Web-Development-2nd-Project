# Web Development 2 Project
For my final Web Development 2 project, I designed and built an Airbnb-style website using HTML and CSS. I researched different Airbnb designs for inspiration and focused on creating a clean, user-friendly layout. I also designed custom logos in Adobe Photoshop and learned how to create and use web icons.
